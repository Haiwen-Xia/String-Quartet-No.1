**I attempt to record the dance of life, where characters take the stage in full regalia, only to be grounded into dust.**

**I attempt to fill the void with nothingness.**

**I attempt to capture the trace of fate, listening to its footsteps, witnessing its masterful works, and mocking it within my power.**

**I attempt to retain the happiness hard-won.**

**I attempt to provide the ultimate answer.**
